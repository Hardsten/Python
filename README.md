Random python codes that I have done.


The files data.py, mail.py, print_and_logg.py and ser_status.py belongs together.

That is a project I worked on, to make a Raspberry pi act as a mediaplayer with pi_video_looper.
The RPi checks status from a projector thru serial and alerts by email if the projector is off, if the RPi is to hot, if the ram is running low or if the omxplayer isnt running.
The print_and_logg.py file is the file to run, and it also saves the data to a logg.txt file on the same place as the files are stored.
